#### I am Ilem Leisher (eye-lem lesher), an undergraduate at Grinnell College in Iowa studying physics. I research computational astrophysics and high energy physics, and have interests in many fields, including (but not limited to!): astroparticle physics, quantumn computing, the study of dark matter, neuroscience, cosmology, radio astronomy, sustainable energy, and quantum consciousness. 

#### I am working to increase my range of experience in physics and computing, with the aim of asymptotically approaching the field that I am best at, I enjoy the most, and is most meaningful to society.

### I am always looking for new projects to work on, so please do not hesitate to email me (ilemleisher@gmail.com) if you want to work on something!
