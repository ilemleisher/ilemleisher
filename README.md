#### I am Ilem Leisher (eye-lem lesher), an undergraduate at Grinnell College in Iowa studying physics. I research computational astrophysics, and have interests in many fields of physics, including (but not limited to!): astroparticle physics, high energy physics, quantumn computing, cosmology, radio astronomy, sustainable energy, and quantum consciousness. 

#### I am working to increase my range of experience in physics, with the aim of asymptotically approaching the field that I am best at, I enjoy the most, and is most meaningful to society. At that point, I hope to begin a PhD in that field. For now-- I will keep researching, learning, and trying new things!

#### I have only relatively recently begun coding (about two years ago), and so I do not have many repositories. However, I love coding a lot, and so I hope my profile will build up over the years, with research codes, personal projects, and more!

### I am always looking for new projects to work on, so please do not hesitate to email me (ilemleisher@gmail.com) if you want to work on something!
